## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview

This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game allows two players to play against each other in a web browser. Players take turns to place their markers (X or O) on the game board. The game announces the winner or a draw based on the player's moves.

## Features

- Two-player mode
- Interactive game board with clickable cells
- Victory and draw messages
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Visual feedback with CSS styling

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on any empty cell to place your marker (X or O).
3. The game alternates between Player X and Player O.
4. The game ends when either player wins or all cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
